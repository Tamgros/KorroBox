## KorroBox smart contracts authored by me

These are the contracts necessary to allow a smart contract to accept <br>
variable pricing. Main deployed contract is the "korrBoxSteamGames.sol" <br>
contract. It inherets from the others.

truffle_consol_stuff.sol is an example of how to sign prices for your users.

Useful for running promotions or taxing users based on local tax laws .
